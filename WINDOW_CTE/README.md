When factoring heat generation required for the manufacturing and transportation of products, Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to products, from food to sneakers to appliances, make up more than 75% of global emissions. (Source: The Carbon Catalogue https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9).<br/>
Our data, which is publicly available on nature.com, contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent). You'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!
