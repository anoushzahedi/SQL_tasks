Each project includes the necessary documentation for understanding. <br/>

Each project is located in a separate subfolder that contains all the necessary data, information, and functions for that project. <br/>

List of Projects:<br/>

## (1) [Join](JOIN/)
In this project, you'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. You'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data. Your search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. You'll also filter, group, and order data. Make sure you brush up on these skills before trying this project! The database contains two tables. Each table has been limited to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on Kaggle.<br/>
## (2) [Subquerry and common_table_expression](SUBQUERY_CTE/)
You're working for a company that sells motorcycle parts, and they've asked for some help in analyzing their sales data! The board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. You have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only `"Wholesale"` orders are included.
## (3) [Window fucntion and common_table_expression](WINDOW_CTE/)
When factoring heat generation required for the manufacturing and transportation of products, Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to products, from food to sneakers to appliances, make up more than 75% of global emissions. (Source: The Carbon Catalogue https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9).<br/>
Our data, which is publicly available on nature.com, contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) for various companies. PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent). You'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!
## (4) [Join with common_table_expression](JOIN_CTE/)
GoodThought NGO has been a catalyst for positive change, focusing its efforts on education, healthcare, and sustainable development to make a significant difference in communities worldwide. This project offers a hands-on opportunity to explore how data-driven insights can direct and enhance these humanitarian efforts. You will execute SQL queries to answer two questions:<br/>
1. List the top five assignments based on the total value of donations, categorized by donor type.<br/>
2. Identify the assignment with the highest impact score in each region, ensuring that each listed assignment has received at least one donation.
## (5) [Simple query](SIMPLE_QUERY/)
Humans not only take debts to manage necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to the following questions:<br/>
1. What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?<br/>
2. What country has the highest amount of debt?<br/>
3. What country has the lowest amount of repayments?
